# Unit 1 Access to success

## Passage

### Script

Nothing fosters success better than confidence. When you are truly and justifiably confident, it radiates from you like sunlight and attracts success to you like a magnet. It's so important to believe in yourself - to believe that you can achieve anything under any circumstances. If you believe you can, you really will. This belief just keeps you striving for success, and soon enough, you will achieve it. Confidence is more than an attitude. It comes from knowing exactly where you are going and how to get there. It comes from a strong sense of purpose. It comes from a firm commitment to taking responsibility, rather than just letting life happen.

One way to develop confidence is to do the things you fear and get a record of successful experiences. Confidence isn't just thinking you can do something; it's believing you can do it and realizing that you are capable of accomplishing anything you set your mind to. Note that confidence should not be confused with self-importance. Self-importance is born out of fear and insecurity, while confidence comes from strength and integrity.

With confidence, persistent effort, determination, and commitment, it's possible to achieve anything. If your life is not what you long for, remember that you have the power to change it. You should make changes on a daily basis. Live with your goals; live each moment with your priorities in mind, and you will have the life you desire.

## Lecture 1

### Script

When I was 27 years old, I made the decision totake up a challenging job: teaching. I went to teachseventh graders math in a public school. Like anyother teacher, I made quizzes and tests and gaveout homework assignments. When the work cameback, I calculated grades.

What struck me was that IQ was not the onlydifference between my highest-performingstudents and those who faced challenges. I foundthat some of my smartest kids were not doing wellin school, and some of my best students did nothave extraordinary IQ scores. That got methinking. The kinds of things you need to learn inseventh-grade math are hard, of course. But theyare not impossible, and I was firmly convinced thatevery student could learn the material if theyworked hard and long enough.

So I went to graduate school to become apsychologist. I embarked on a journey of studyingindividuals in all kinds of challenging environmentsto understand what contributes to theirsuccess. After numerous studies, I found that gritconsistently emerged as a strong predictor ofsuccess.

Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-termgoals. Grit is having stamina. Grit is sticking with your future for years and working really hard to make that future a reality. Grit is living life like it's amarathon, not a sprint. To me, the most shocking thing about grit is how little we know about it and how little science knowsabout building it. So far, the best idea I've heard about building grit in kids is something called growth mindset", the belief that the ability to learnis not fixed and can improve with effort. Studies have shown that when children understand how the brain grows and changes in response to challenges, they're more likely to persevere after they fail, because they don't believe that failure is apermanent condition.

So growth mindset is a great idea for building grit. But we need more ideas and research. And that's the work that stands before us. We need tomeasure whether we've been successful, and wehave to be willing to fail, to be wrong, and to startall over again with lessons learned. In other words,we need to be gritty about getting our kids grittier.

### Questions

1. What did the speaker discover when teaching math in a public school?

    A Some students could not finish
    homework assignments.

    B Seventh-grade math was very difficult
    for most students.

    C Every student could work hard to
    understand the material.

    **D IQ wasn't the only factor that influenced students' performance.**

2. What topic interested the speaker as a psychologist?

    A Challenges and mental health.

    B IQ and academic performance.

    **C Factors contributing to success.**

    D Mental health and environment.

3. What does the speaker say about grit?

    **A We have little knowledge about how to build it.**

    B Grit means living life passionately like it's a sprint.

    C It's better to develop grit in students at a younger age.

    D Students' grit can improve as their learning ability grows.

Today, I would like to address a universal issue that affects us at some point in our lives: procrastination. It's common for many of us to delay important tasks, thinking we will handle them later, but this often makes us feel overwhelmed with stress as deadlines approach. Now, let's
examine the harmful effects of procrastination and explore effective strategies to overcome it.

Procrastination can have damaging effects on our
lives. When we delay tasks, we compromise our overall productivity. Procrastination limits our
ability to reach our full potential, as it weakens our
motivation, efficiency, and the quality of our
work. As a result, we become trapped in a cycle of
anxiety and self-doubt, which hinders our personal
growth.

So, how can we overcome this habit? The key lies
in understanding the root causes of procrastination
and applying strategies to deal with it. Here are
three effective strategies that we can follow:

First, we should set clear goals and prioritize
tasks. It is essential to establish goals that are clear,
specific, and achievable. Try to break down tasks
into smaller, manageable steps and prioritize them
based on urgency and importance. This not only
provides clarity but also ensures that we focus on
the most crucial tasks first. By organizing our
responsibilities in this way, we can eliminate the
overwhelming feeling that often leads to
procrastination.

Second, we should create a structured
environment. Our environment can greatly
influence our ability to stay focused and
motivated. Try to minimize distractions by turning
off phone notifications and creating an organized
workspace. It is also a good idea to surround
ourselves with visual cues that strengthen our
goals, such as inspirational quotes or motivational
images. This can enhance concentration and help
resist the urge to procrastinate.

Third, we should utilize time management
techniques. Explore techniques like the Pomodoro
Technique, which involves working in focused
intervals followed by short breaks. This method
enhances productivity, minimizes burnout, and
adds a sense of urgency that discourages
procrastination. Furthermore, learn to utilize tools
such as to-do lists, calendars, and task
management apps for better time management.

Remember, success is not achieved overnight; it is
the result of consistent effort. By sticking to these
strategies, we can overcome procrastination and
pave the way for a more productive and fulfilling
life. Together, let's conquer this harmful habit and
embrace success.

# Unit 2 Emotions speak louder than words

## Passage

### Script

With the fierce competition at school, you may feel
stressed out and easily offended. How can you
relieve such stress? Follow these tips to reduce
your stress to manageable levels!

Avoid MUST thinking. Move away from the notion
that you must do something in a certain way. For
example, you may think, "I must get a high score on
this test." This type of thinking only adds to the
stress you're experiencing. Instead, assess your
situation rationally and analytically, and don't view
it as a life-and-death matter.

Set manageable goals. Large projects can seem
overwhelming, but if you break them down into
smaller tasks, things become a lot easier. This
allows you to focus on one task at a time, and

every time you complete a task, you'll experience a
sense of achievement.

Imagine dumping your worries. Picture yourself
walking on a beautiful beach with a bucket. Stop at
a good spot, put your worries into the bucket, then
drop the bucket, and watch as it slowly drifts away
into the ocean.

Use your bed for sleeping, not studying. When you
bring assignments to bed, your mind may start to
associate your bed with these tasks, which can
make falling asleep more difficult. Instead, keeping
your bed as a place just for sleeping promotes
faster and better sleep. It helps you disconnect
from daily stresses and can potentially enhance
your overall productivity.

By applying these tips to your life, you'll soon
encounter fewer situations that cause you stress.

### Questions

1. What will happen if we always think we must do something in a certain way?

    A We will become less flexible.

    **B We will experience more stress.**

    C We will become narrow-minded.

    D We will lose our ability to think critically.

2. How can we make a large project easier, according to the passage?

Jealousy is a common emotion that many of us
may experience at some point in our lives. Often
referred to as "the green-eyed monster" - and
rightfully so - it can be quite harmful. This complex
and sometimes irrational emotion can have
profound effects on our relationships, personal
growth, and overall happiness.

Jealousy typically arises from feelings of insecurity,
fear, or inadequacy. It is often triggered by the
belief that someone else possesses something we
desire, be it material possessions, success,
attention, or even love. The moment we begin
comparing ourselves to others, these comparisons
can lead to feelings of unhappiness, bitterness, and
even hostility. It is crucial to recognize that jealousy
is a natural emotion, and the first step toward
managing it is acknowledging its presence.

One of the main causes of jealousy is low self-
esteem. When we doubt our own worth and
capabilities, we tend to be jealous of
others. Therefore, it is essential to cultivate
confidence and appreciate our unique qualities anc
strengths. Remember, we are all on our own
journey; comparing ourselves to others only
diminishes our self-worth.

Another cause of jealousy is a lack of trust and
communication, two key foundations of successful
relationships. For instance, when we feel insecure
about our partner's feelings or intentions, we can
be consumed by jealousy. It is thus essential to
regularly express our concerns and actively listen
to our partner, which can help ease feelings of
jealousy.

Social media has also become a breeding ground
for jealousy. We are constantly flooded with
carefully created images of perfect beauty,
luxurious lifestyles, and seemingly effortless
success. However, it is important to bear in mind
that these carefully selected images rarely reflect
reality, and comparing ourselves to these filtered
snapshots is neither fair nor healthy. To overcome
jealousy, we should focus on our own personal
growth and achievements in real life instead of
comparing ourselves to others online.

Let's remember that we are all unique individuals
on our own life paths, and being jealous only
hinders our own progress. If we embrace our own
journey and celebrate the success of others,
jealousy will naturally fade from our lives.

### Questions

1. What is the first step toward managing jealousy?

    A Cultivating self-esteem.

    **B Acknowledging its presence.**

    C Focusing on personal growth

    D Stopping making comparisons.

2. How can we alleviate jealousy in a relationship?

    A By building trust with our partner.

    B By figuring out the reasons behind our jealousy.

    **C By expressing concerns and listening to our partner.**

    D By appreciating our own unique qualities and strengths.

3. Why has social media turned into a breeding ground for jealousy?

    A It leaves us with little time to focus on self-growth.

    B It discourages us from communicating with others.

    C It leads to a constant need for acceptance and recognition.

    **D It leads to misguided perceptions and unhealthy comparisons.**

## Lecture 2

### Script

Nobody's life is perfect, and it's unrealistic to
expect our emotions to always be positive. While
we all appreciate positive emotions, we must also
acknowledge that challenging moments in life can
give rise to negative emotions.

Negative emotions are a natural part of our
lives. When we look back on the greatest
achievements of individuals throughout history, we
often find that the paths to those achievements
were marked by various negative emotions, such as
fear, doubt, or frustration. For example, the first
man on the moon may have experienced a variety
of negative emotions in the time leading up to his
historic step. Similarly, an Olympic champion may
have had to endure a mix of negative emotions
before winning a gold medal.

During challenging times, our instinct may tell us to
avoid or hide negative emotions, but doing so only
prolongs our discomfort. Instead, we can learn to
embrace our negative emotions and transform
them into positive actions. Here are some practical
tips for dealing with them.

First, awareness is key. Once you recognize the
negative emotion you're experiencing, take a
moment to pause and acknowledge its
presence. For example, if you feel embarrassed,
consciously acknowledge this feeling by saying to
yourself, "I know there is embarrassment within
me."

Next, practice acceptance. Realize that negative
emotions won't last forever - they come and go like
ocean waves, rising and receding. Your task is
simply to allow these waves of emotions to pass
through you and observe them with patience.

Then, when you are calm enough, explore your
emotions to understand the causes behind
them. The causes might include unnecessary
worries about someone or lasting thoughts about a
casual remark from a colleague.

Finally, choose an appropriate response. This may
involve engaging in self-care practices, seeking
professional support, or expressing emotions
through creative outlets. Remember that finding
the most suitable response is an ongoing process,
so be patient with yourself.

In short, when we are faced with negative
emotions, it's important to acknowledge and
accept them, reflect on their causes, and respond
appropriately. So, let's embrace every emotion we
encounter as we embark on our journey of self-
discovery and growth.

### Questions

1. What can we learn about negative emotions from the passage?

    A They generally fade away slowly.

    B They form a large part of our lives.

    C They are mainly associated with failures.

    **D They often mark the path to great achievements.**

2. What is the result of avoiding or suppressing negative emotions?

    A It reduces negative emotions temporarily.

    **B It prolongs the impact of negative emotions.**

    C It diminishes our awareness of negative emotions.

    D It helps us better deal with negative emotions later.

3. When is a suitable time to think about the causes of our negative emotions?

    **A When we are calm enough.**

    B When we recognize their presence.

    C When we can get support from professionals.

    D When we are worrying about unnecessary things.

4. Why does dealing with negative emotions need patience?

    A Negative emotions are constantly changing.

    B It takes time for negative emotions to fade away.

    C Identifying the causes of negative emotions can be difficult.

# Unit 3 Love your neighbor

## Passage

### Script

Living in a community means we're likely to
encounter disputes with our neighbors from time
to time. Disputes can range from trivial matters,
such as noise complaints, to more serious issues
like property damage. Here are some tips for
handling such situations:

Get to know each other. Being a good neighbor
doesn't mean you have to take family vacations
together. It could be as simple as knowing your
neighbors well enough to say "hello" or perhaps
occasionally borrowing things like a cup of sugar or
a gardening tool. All these actions can help build
trust and understanding. Issues are much more
likely to occur among strangers than among even
casual acquaintances.

Head off problems before they become
problems. If you are going to throw a party, visit all
neighbors who might be affected and offer them a
card with your phone number. If they find the noise
intolerable or if other problems occur, your
neighbors can call you directly instead of involving
the police.

Communicate your concerns clearly. Tell your
neighbors what's bothering you - don't assume
they know what the problem is. Be open and
direct, not passive-aggressive. Ask for their
opinions and, whenever possible, suggest a
solution that reaches a middle ground or
demonstrates your willingness to compromise. Stay
cool and remain positive, even if your neighbors do
not.

Involve more neighbors. See if anyone else on your
block is experiencing similar issues - they may be
willing to help you resolve the situation together. If
some of your neighbors have a good relationship
with the person causing problems, consider having
them join the conversation when you talk it out.

Bottom line? Resolving disputes with our neighbors
is all about effective communication. Remember,
the goal isn't to win an argument but to live in
harmony with those around us.

### Questions

1. How can we build trust and understanding with our neighbors?

    A By visiting them frequently.

    **B By getting to know each other.**

    C By organizing parties together.

    D By taking family vacations together.

2. What should we do if we are likely to cause problems for our neighbors?

    A Address problems appropriately when they occur.

    B Apologize to our neighbors when problems occur.

    **C Take action beforehand to avoid potential problems.**

    D Immediately cease activities that may cause problems.

3. How should we react if our neighbors are bothering us?

    A We should involve the police for help.

    B We should wait patiently for their explanations.

    **C We should express our concerns and discuss solutions together.**

    D We should involve more family members to address the problem.

## Lecture 1

### Script

Ladies and gentlemen, today I would like to talk
about effective strategies for fostering a strong
connection between your business and the local
community. Whether you're the owner of a
sandwich shop or any other local establishment, it's
important to prioritize the needs of your
community. This is because your most loyal
customers are more likely to be your neighbors
down the street, rather than those who have to
drive 20 minutes to pick up a sandwich for
lunch. Your goal should be to make your business a
familiar and trusted presence in their lives - a
neighbor they can rely on for great experiences.

Reaching out to people in your neighborhood can
be as simple as offering coupons or handing out
samples. However, building a genuine connection
with the community goes beyond such gestures. It
is crucial to actively get involved in the
community. To do so, consider supporting and
joining organizations that match your business
values. For example, you can sponsor local schools
and sports teams or participate in local fairs. This
can not only establish your credibility but also
strengthen the bond between your business and
the community.

To strengthen the connection you've already made
with the community, you can further tailor your
marketing efforts to the specific needs of your
neighborhood. Choose an appropriate advertising
medium that best suits your neighborhood,
whether through print publications or online
platforms. Seeing your business name advertised
through these channels can remind the local
community of the positive relationships you've
already established with them and may encourage
them to become your loyal customers. Moreover,
consider creating loyalty programs that involve
issuing loyalty cards to customers. These cards can
be used to record information about what your
customers buy and to reward them for buying
goods from your business. By doing this, local
customers will be more willing to support your
business.

By actively engaging with local residents and
tailoring your marketing efforts, you can help your
business establish a strong presence and become
an integral part of the neighborhood. The
connections and loyalty fostered within the
community will not only solidify your position as a
trusted, irreplaceable neighbor, but also ensure the
continued success of your business.

### Questions

1. Who are the most likely loyal customers of a sandwich shop, according to the lecture?

    A People who love sandwiches.

    B People who are offered coupons.

    **C Local residents living down the street.**

    D Office workers living in the community.

2. Which of the following methods is crucial to building a genuine connection between a business and the local community?

    A Offering coupons.

    B Distributing free lunches.

    C Handing out free samples.

    **D Sponsoring local organizations.**

3. Which of the following strategies is effective in reinforcing the connection between a business and the local community?

    **A Creating loyalty programs.**

    B Offering more discounts to customers.

    C Choosing several advertising platforms.

    D Working with the most suitable marketing company.

## Lecture 2

### Script

Today, we gather here to explore the profound
concept of boundaries and their impact on our
lives. Inspired by Robert Frost's famous poem
"Mending Wall", we will explore how boundaries
can preserve privacy but may also lead to
isolation.

Frost's poem introduced the timeless saying "Good
fences make good neighbors", which highlights the
importance of boundaries in maintaining harmony
and a sense of security. In this context, well-
defined boundaries can protect our privacy and
serve as a shield against trespassing. By
maintaining such boundaries, neighbors can create
a healthy degree of distance, which helps avoid the
disregard of each other's privacy and cultivate a
peaceful atmosphere.

However, it is important to recognize that when
taken to the extreme, boundaries can result in
isolation. In the past, low fences facilitated casual
interactions among neighbors, enabling them to
engage in friendly conversations about everyday
matters. So, while indicating personal space, these
fences didn't prevent individuals from reaching out
to their neighbors. Unfortunately, in today's world,
even though physical fences are often absent, an
overemphasis on invisible boundaries for self-
protection has impeded the free exchange of ideas
and cultural intermingling. Ultimately, this may
stifle personal and societal growth.

In conclusion, the age-old belief that "Good fences
make good neighbors" continues to hold relevance
in modern times, especially when it comes to
personal space and privacy protection. However, it
is important to note that an overemphasis on
boundaries can have negative
consequences. Instead of building invisible barriers
that block communication, we should aim for
respectful and meaningful interactions without
sacrificing privacy. This can be achieved through
regular gatherings and face-to-face exchanges
that encourage sincere communication and
relationship building. In this way, we can create a
community that values open conversation, mutual
respect, and cooperation.

Let us remember that boundaries should never
become barriers that limit our ability to
communicate, empathize, and form deep bonds
with one another. Together, we can overcome the
challenges posed by invisible boundaries and
embrace gateways that enhance understanding,
compassion, and communication.

### Questions

1. Why are well-defined boundaries beneficial?

    **A They help protect privacy and prevent trespassing.**

    B They separate one's property from their neighbors'.

    C They prevent the occurrence of neighborhood disputes.

    D They enhance safety by defining the zones for specific activities.

2. What does the speaker say about boundaries in the past?

    A They were solid and well-defined.

    B They were more visible and tangible.

    C They were not reliable in terms of safety.

    **D They were not harmful to neighborly communication.**

3. What is the possible consequence of overemphasizing boundaries in today's world?

    A There will be fewer casual interactions.

    B There will be fewer gatherings and parties.

    **C There will be fewer free exchanges of ideas.**

    D There will be a misleading sense of security.

4. How should we address boundaries in modern times, according to the lecture?

    A By making more efforts to prevent invisible boundaries.

    **B By overcoming the challenges posed by invisible boundaries.**

    C By striking a balance between invisible and physical boundaries.

    D By removing all forms of boundaries to promote communication.

# Unit 4 What's the big idea

## Passage

### Script

Scientific research is intended to improve the
overall quality of our lives. The government should
provide financial and policy support for research
that is likely to produce significant benefits for the
public. However, opinions vary regarding
government support for scientific research that
lacks immediate practical uses. Nevertheless, many
believe that the government should allocate
sufficient funds for all scientific research aimed at
improving public welfare, regardless of its short-
term practical uses.

Certain scientific research, whose social benefits
are immediate, predictable, and profound, should
continue to receive support. For example,
biotechnology research has provided new methods
for disease treatment and prevention; studies in
information technology have made education more
accessible; and research in communication
technology has facilitated exchanges among
people.

However, this does not imply that research with
less clear or immediate benefits should be given a
lower priority. It is difficult to predict which
research will ultimately contribute most to
society. A reluctance to fund such research could
hinder the exploration of new knowledge. This has
been notably true in the field of computer
science. For instance, some people initially
opposed heavy investment in computer research
due to its seemingly unknown
applications. However, computers have
transformed the way we live and proven to be of
great benefit in the long run across diverse fields
including medicine, aviation, and education.

Therefore, we should never dismiss any scientific
research with unknown outcomes as
unworthy. After all, the primary objective of any
research is to discover truths, whatever they might
be.

### Questions

1. What do people disagree about regarding scientific research?

    A Whether research should be conducted for its immediate benefits.

    B Whether research should continue even without financial support.

    C Whether the government should distribute funds for research equally.

    **D Whether the government should support research with less immediate value.**

2. Why should we value research with unknown benefits?

    A Such research is also aimed at discovering truths.

    B Much of such research has proven beneficial to society.

    C Such research can have a long-term impact on our society.

    **D Failure to support such research hinders the discovery of new knowledge.**

3. What does the speaker say about computer research?

    A Computer research was given priority even in the face of opposition.

    **B Computer research was not well-received at first but has proven beneficial.**

    C People have always been aware of the practical benefits of computer research.

    D The progress of computer research was slow at first due to insufficient funding.

Are you familiar with the saying, "Insanity is doing
the same thing over and over again but expecting
different results"? Many of us may find ourselves
trapped in this very cycle, wondering why we aren't
achieving better outcomes.

But here's the good news: You can break free from
this pattern. The solution lies in taking a step back
and allowing your mind to wander
freely. Daydreaming, the act of disconnecting from
the chaotic world around you, enables your mind to
travel, reflect, and piece together information in
new and innovative ways.

Actually, we all indulge in daydreaming to some
extent. Psychologists point out that people
daydream for approximately 47 percent of their
waking hours. This is because boredom causes our
minds to wander, making daydreaming the brain's
spontaneous response to unproductive or
unfulfilling time.

Ironically, daydreaming is often criticized. We are
often taught in school that focus is the key to
success. However, research suggests that the
process of daydreaming plays a crucial role in
enhancing creativity. It empowers us to generate
and communicate original ideas that can lead to
new inventions, strategies, and theories.

Daydreaming is also one of the most effective ways
to learn about ourselves. It provides us with
valuable time for introspection, a period during
which we gain a clearer understanding of our
strengths and weaknesses. This is beneficial in
promoting both our professional and personal
growth.

Moreover, daydreaming helps take our goals and
dreams beyond mere thoughts. When we allow
ourselves to daydream, we step outside our
immediate fears and worries, and instead, we open
our minds to endless possibilities. This mental
process encourages ambitious planning and helps
us embrace a mindset that is beneficial for
achieving success.

Of course, it's necessary to exercise control over
daydreaming. It can be costly when daydreaming
occurs at inappropriate times, like during a board
meeting. The ability to focus your attention on the
task at hand should never be overlooked.

Sometimes, it's essential to escape from the chaos
of the present and discover a new path to
success. So, if you feel stuck in a monotonous
routine, simply allow yourself to daydream for a
while. This can ignite the spark of creativity
necessary for your next remarkable achievement.

Are you creative, innovative, or artistic? These are
not interchangeable terms. Today, I will explain how
they are related but different.

If you can draw or paint, does that make you
creative? If you design a product that is unknown
to others, are you being innovative?

Now, you must understand that being able to draw
or paint doesn't necessarily make you
creative. Artistic ability is essentially about
cultivating skills and talents. This can involve
creating fine works of art like drawings, paintings,
and sculptures. Artists often employ such skills to
create works of art to evoke emotional responses.

Creativity, on the other hand, is more about the
development of new ideas. It is the ability to think
outside the box and combine different elements to
form a solution to a particular problem. For
example, in a science project, the objective often
involves finding solutions that serve a specific
purpose. In my view, the only difference between
being creative and being artistic lies in the
destination. Creative work is mostly outward-
focused on the target audience, while art is more
inward-focused. Most art we see is some kind of
self-reflection or self-expression of the creator.

Another thing we must recognize is that creativity
is a necessary precondition for
innovation. Innovation is about implementing or
creating something new that can bring value to
others. The outcome of innovation is often tangible
and represents a fundamental shift from the
conventional. Therefore, creativity involves
generating ideas and envisioning what is possible
in the first place, while innovation is about taking
action and making those ideas a reality. Simply put,
creativity is an imaginative process, whereas
innovation is a productive one.

So, as you can see, art is inward-focused and
mostly centered on personal expression. Creativity
is outward-focused and primarily concerned with
imagination or ideation. And innovation is a
process - a way of turning ideas into action and
bringing creative ideas to life. That's why these
terms are somewhat related, yet distinctly different
from one another.

### Questions

1. What can we learn about being artistic from the lecture?

    **A It involves developing skills and talents.**

    B It is the ability to think outside the box.

    C It is about doing something that's unknown to others.

    D It means creating for specific listeners, viewers, or users.

2. What is creativity, according to the lecture?

    **A It involves the development of new ideas.**

    B It involves self-reflection or self-expression.

    C It is about turning imaginative ideas into reality.

    D It is about employing artistic skills to create something.

3. What does the speaker say about innovation?

    A It is more of an imaginative process than a productive one.

    B It represents a spontaneous departure from the mainstream.

    C It often leads to outcomes that can be seen in various forms.

    **D It is about creating something new that can bring value to others.**

4. What is the difference between creativity and innovation?

    A Innovation is a process; creativity is the final product.

    **B Creativity helps generate ideas; innovation applies them.**

    C Innovation is linked to science; creativity is linked to art.

    D Creativity is inward-focused; innovation is outward-focused.

## Passage

### Script

Once, I had a wonderful job at a marvelous
company. I enjoyed flexible working hours, an
understanding boss, and a high salary. I loved my
job. However, after six years of trying out various
professional roles, I felt that I had outgrown my
passion for the fixed positions available at the
company.

I must admit, having a lot of money is nice. Money
can buy you things, nice things. Yet, the popular
saying is true - money cannot buy you happiness,
and having a lot of money doesn't make you a
successful person. After several years, I realized
that the more money I made, the less satisfied I
became. Time flew by, and my days started to
blend together. I found myself deeply longing for
something more meaningful.

Upon realizing that I was trading my time for
money, I began to explore other sources of
income. I've started and ended businesses, turned
hobbies into professional pursuits, and tested out
different investment strategies.

In the end, I've learned that it doesn't matter what
you are doing. As long as you do something that
reflects your passion, you will feel great and
achieve a sense of fulfillment. I've also learned that
starting something from scratch and watching it
grow is deeply satisfying.

Through my quest for passion, I've finally
discovered that working online as a freelance
writer is just my cup of tea. It enables me to share
ideas and lessons learned, which gives me a sense
of accomplishment. For the first time in my life, I
feel like I am truly living my life's purpose.

Today, I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to talk
about a profession that is not only challenging but
also fascinating: interpreting. As an interpreter
myself, I can assure you that this is a dynamic
career, filled with numerous interesting and
rewarding experiences.

I still vividly remember a conference where I
interpreted for a well-known author from
Spain. During the conference, I successfully
conveyed his powerful ideas to an audience that
couldn't understand his language. Witnessing the
audience's reactions - their laughter and even their
tears - was incredibly rewarding. This experience
constantly reminds me of the profound impact
interpreting can have on people.

One of the most incredible aspects of being an
interpreter is having the opportunity to broaden
our horizons. As interpreters, we often play a
crucial role in various events, conferences, and
meetings, where we interact with people from
diverse backgrounds and cultures. Such
experiences truly open our eyes to different
cultures and help us gain a better understanding of
diverse viewpoints. It feels like embarking on a
never-ending journey of exploration and
knowledge acquisition.

Another amazing aspect of being an interpreter is
the privilege of witnessing history unfold right
before our eyes. We often find ourselves in high-
level diplomatic negotiations or international
conferences, where critical decisions are usually
made. Just imagine having a front-row seat to
conversations that could shape the course of
countries or even the world. As interpreters, we are
the indispensable bridge between cultures,
facilitating effective communication at those
crucial moments.

Moreover, being an interpreter provides countless
opportunities for personal development. Each task
presents unique challenges, from mastering
technical terminology for a science conference to
conveying the emotional depth and subtleties of a
powerful speech. Our abilities to think and respond
quickly, maintain composure under pressure, and
adapt to various speaking styles constantly improve
with each experience.

So, if you have a passion for languages, cultures,
and the art of communication, why not explore the
fascinating world of interpreting?

Today, let's talk about the psychological benefits of
commuting to and from work. Many people may
think of commuting as a waste of time, but a study
has revealed that it can provide a form of "in-
between" space, a time free from both home and
work roles. It allows us to recover and mentally
switch gears to another environment.

However, with the new normal of working from
home, this space is likely to be lost amid the
blurred boundaries between work and home
life. Interestingly, even those working from home
may choose to regularly sit in their cars at the end
of their workday in an attempt to mark the
transition from work to home life.

The study also suggests that commuters can
restore their mental energy used up during the
workday by detaching themselves from the office
or home environment. Longer commutes offer
more time for such detachment and recovery, yet
even a 15-minute walk around the block at both
the beginning and end of the workday can be all
that's needed for this.

However, it's important to note that certain factors
may undermine the positive effects of
commuting. For instance, car commuters must
focus on the road, while train commuters have to
monitor arrivals or departures and ensure they get
off at the right stop. Meanwhile, dwelling on the
negatives of the workday or stressful situations can
reduce the time available for disengagement and
recharging. In such cases, it's worthwhile to make
adjustments to ensure a more positive and fulfilling
commute. For instance, busy roads often lead to
increasing stress, so seeking less congested routes
could be beneficial. Sitting in hour-long traffic is
never anyone's idea of fun, so try activities such as
listening to music or calling a friend.

In conclusion, it is crucial for us to recognize and
take advantage of the "in-between" space provided
by commuting. Whether your commute includes a
short walk or a long drive, use this time to relax
and mentally disengage from the environment
you've been in for most of the day. This can
significantly enhance your overall well-being.

### Questions

1. What can we learn about the "in-between" space from the lecture?

    A It leads to increased levels of stress.

    **B It provides time for detachment and recovery.**

    C It blurs the boundaries between work and home life.

    D It encourages greater mental engagement and productivity.

2. According to the lecture, what may undermine the positive effects of commuting?

    A Focusing on the road map.

    B Getting off at the wrong bus stop.

    C Taking a longer commute every day.

    **D Dwelling on the negatives of the workday.**

3. Which of the following is mentioned in the lecture as a means of making our commute more positive and fulfilling?

    A Spending less time on the road.

    **B Engaging in conversations with friends.**

    C Watching the changing scenery along the way.

    D Choosing comfortable means of transportation.

# Unit 6 For every question there is an answer

## Passage

### Script

Every relationship in our lives, from friendships to
romantic relationships, can potentially be
destroyed by conflicts. The solution, however, is
not to ignore conflicts or keep searching for
perfect people. Resolving conflicts in relationships
is one of the most important life skills we should
develop. So, how can we effectively resolve
conflicts?

First, when faced with a difficult problem, we
should consider the problem from other people's
perspectives. This does not mean we have to agree
with their points; rather, we should try to
understand the issue from different angles. Such
empathy can help us understand why others hold
their particular attitudes or beliefs. If we only look
at things from our own perspective, conflicts are
much more likely to occur.

Second, we need to be tolerant. A major cause of
conflicts in relationships is our expectations of how
people should behave. The problem with this is
that we become upset when others fail to meet our
expectations. Thus, we need to be tolerant of other
people's mistakes and respect their choices and
decisions.

Third, we should engage in open
communication. When tense situations arise,
communication is often the most effective way to
deal with them. We should try to focus on positive
issues and look for things we can work on
together. Some things are best left unsaid, and it is
inadvisable to bring up old conflicts unless
necessary.

No conflict is unsolvable. If we are willing to
change our attitudes, we can resolve conflicts in

our relationships and lead a more harmonious and

peaceful life.

### Questions

1. Why is it important to consider problems from other people's perspectives?

    A It helps us agree with other people's points.

    B It helps us be better understood by other people.

    C It helps us understand the backgrounds of other people.

    **D It helps us understand the reasons behind other people's points.**

2. What is a major cause of conflicts in relationships, according to the passage?

    A We don't respect other people's decisions.

    B We get upset with other people's misbehavior.

    **C We expect other people to behave in a certain way.**

    D We blame other people for their mistakes and limitations.

3. How should we solve problems through communication?

    A By looking for things that are left unsaid.

    B By bringing up old conflicts and solving them.

    C By talking frankly and honestly to earn each other's trust.

    **D By focusing on positive issues and seeking common ground.**

4. What is the passage mainly about?

    A Different types of conflicts in our relationships.

    **B Suggestions on dealing with conflicts in our relationships.**

    C Suggestions on how to avoid conflicts in our relationships.

    D Reasons behind various types of conflicts in our relationships.

So, this project started when a few of my
teammates visited Central America and saw
beaches littered with styrofoam. When they came
back and told us about this, we began to think
about the ways we use styrofoam. It's a material we
encounter every day, whether in disposable
utensils, takeout containers, or kids' toys.

Where do all these items go after their one-time
use? Regrettably, there are no effective solutions
for dealing with used styrofoam, so most of it ends
up in landfills, oceans, and beaches, where it takes
over 500 years to degrade.

So, we asked ourselves: What if we could find a
new use for styrofoam, one that takes advantage of
its low-cost, lightweight, and insulating properties,
but does not harm the environment? What if we
could transform it into something else that is
actually useful?

My team supposed that we could convert
styrofoam into activated carbon, a key component
of water filters. We conducted numerous heating
tests but encountered a series of failures. Our
samples either vaporized or exploded, leaving
behind a sticky mess. Despite feeling discouraged
at first, we persisted because we believed that this
could have a positive impact on the environment.

We continued to experiment, facing more setbacks
along the way. Our determination finally paid off
when we achieved the desired result - successfully
creating activated carbon from styrofoam
waste. We not only managed to produce activated
carbon for water purification but also contributed
to reducing styrofoam waste, solving two problems
with one solution.

This breakthrough showed us that what had
seemed impossible could actually be achievable,
and failure is simply an integral part of the journey
to success. This has inspired us to take our project
even further by conducting more tests to make it
more effective and evaluate it in real-world
situations.

### Questions

1. Why is styrofoam an environmental problem?

    A It ends up as litter.

    B It is impossible to degrade.

    **C It is slow to degrade and hard to recycle.**

    D Its manufacturing process is harmful to the environment.

2. How did the team feel at the beginning of the experiment?

    A They were encouraged by their immediate success.

    B They were doubtful about the method of their experiment.

    **C They were discouraged by the numerous failures they faced.**

    D They were relieved as they found the process easier than expected.

3. What is the team's solution for the problem of used styrofoam?

    A Heating it to make it vaporize.

    **B Creating activated carbon from it.**

    C Using several methods to recycle it.

    D Finding a use for it in manufacturing other products.

Today, we'll explore the fascinating concepts of
analytic and holistic thinking styles. Understanding
these two thinking styles can help us foster mutual
understanding and make well-informed choices.

Let's start by looking at the differences between
the two. Analytic thinkers tend to focus on
individual objects and their characteristics,
whereas holistic thinkers consider the broader
context and pay attention to the relationships
between objects. For instance, if asked to describe
a dining table, an analytic thinker may concentrate
on its physical attributes, such as its size and
material. In contrast, a holistic thinker might
emphasize the table's role as a space for family and
friends to share meals and experiences.

Both thinking styles are valuable. Analytic thinkers
are good at separating important details from
irrelevant or distracting ones. This skill is
particularly useful in areas such as finance,
engineering, and science, where precise
calculations and logical reasoning are
critical. Holistic thinkers often excel at seeing the
big picture, identifying connections between
seemingly unrelated pieces of information. This
ability is crucial in fields such as the arts,
psychology, and social sciences, where empathy
and creativity are highly valued.

But where do these thinking styles come
from? Analytic thinking originated in ancient
Greece, where philosophers such as Socrates and
Aristotle sought to understand the world through
logical reasoning. On the other hand, holistic
thinking emerged in ancient China. Famous
Chinese philosophers like Confucius, Mencius, and
Laozi emphasized harmony and balance. However,
as people migrate across regions and interact with
individuals from different cultural backgrounds,
these thinking patterns have been shared and
blended.

It should be noted that no one is born an analytic
or holistic thinker. We acquire these thinking styles
from our environment. Usually, one way of thinking
becomes dominant through our interactions with
others and is further reinforced by cultural
influences.

In short, each thinking style has its own value, and
cultural exchanges have led to a fusion of them. By
recognizing and appreciating the distinctive
qualities of both analytic and holistic thinking, we
can embrace diverse perspectives and better
interpret the complexities of daily life.
